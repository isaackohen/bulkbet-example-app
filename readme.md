[![Bulk.bet Snippet]!]
** A php only full working example to utillize Bulk.bet's Game API to provide more insight and also a quick way to apply API.**

## Getting Started

Simply place contents on a webserver with PHP. Please make sure to CHMOD 777 preferably and by minimum to CHMOD 775 `balance.txt`.

Make sure to place your Bulk.bet API Key on `index.php`.

Afterwards games will work. Callback logs turn in the `callbackLogs` folder so you can keep track of how sessions are started & bets are processed.

On firing up after having set your API-key, it should tell you the exact callback URL's you should point in casino configuration towards.
